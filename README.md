# GpsExtractor
A command line utility that finds all JPEGs inside of a folder
recursively and extracts their EXIF GPS data if present. It will default to
scanning the pwd unless a directory is provided as an argument.

Results are written to a file in the pwd as the scan runs. CSV files will be
produced by default, use -html for HTML files instead. If the app is not
installed as a gem, the HTML output requires configuration when being called
from outside the app folder.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gps_extractor'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gps_extractor

### SYNOPSIS

## Usage
```

 ruby lib/gps_extractor.rb -v
 ruby lib/gps_extractor.rb /home

### OPTIONS
